Schedule Generator
A software system to generate the yearly academic schedule for an entire high school.

Overview
Every year, multiple faculty spend several weeks of their time manually working out a complete academic schedule. 
This process includes collecting data, assigning course sections to “bands”, distributing students across sections, 
and scheduling the bands/sections to periods while avoiding teaching conflicts and accommodating various section and personal constraints. 
Creating a schedule therefore, amounts to solving a medium-scale optimization problem with many constraints. 
This is a classic type of problem where humans struggle, but machines can find the optimal solution by sheer brute force.
The goal of this project is to automate as much of the process described above as possible, reducing manual work to a minimum, 
and generating a close to optimal schedule in a fraction of the time.
